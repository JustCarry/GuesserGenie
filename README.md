## Description of the project
The genie of CS 142 class is a game like 20 questions. 
This will be similar in that the user is asked simple yes, no or I donâ€™t know questions that will then give the genie a clue into what the user is thinking of. 
The number of questions will vary based on the information that is collected from the user.
